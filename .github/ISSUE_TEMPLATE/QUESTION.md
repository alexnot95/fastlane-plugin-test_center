<!--
If you have sensitive data that you do not want to be exposed, please either obfuscate that data (my-secret-token-2020202020 => my-secret-token-######) 
or encrypt it with my public key: https://github.com/lyndsey-ferguson/fastlane-plugin-test_center/files/5577804/lyndsey-ferguson-id_rsa.pub.pkcs8.zip

Refer to this article for more information: https://gist.github.com/colinstein/de1755d2d7fbe27a0f1e

Here are the relevant steps to encrypt your file(s). 

1. Create a password file that you will use to encrypt your file:
```
openssl rand 192 -out secret.txt.key
```
2. Encrypt the file with that secret key:
```
$ openssl aes-256-cbc -in <path/to/your/file> -out <path/to/your/file>.enc -pass file:secret.txt.key
```
3. Encrypt the password file with the attached public key:
```
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey lyndsey-ferguson-id_rsa.pub.pkcs8 -in secret.txt.key -out secret.txt.key.enc
```
4. Package up the encrypted files:
```
zip issue.zip *.enc
```

Attach that zip to this issue.
